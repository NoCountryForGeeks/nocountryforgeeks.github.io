# No country for Geeks

## Getting started

### Launch in localhost

1. Install a full [Ruby development environment](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/)

2. Install Jekyll and bundler gems

`gem install jekyll bundler`

3. Run `bundle install` to install missing gems.

4. Build the site and make it available on a local server

`bundle exec jekyll serve -d _site`

5. Now browse to http://localhost:4000

**Note:** you can build the site with draft using `--draft`. 

`bundle exec jekyll serve --draft -d _site`

### Create Author

To create author you have to add markdown file with author's information at the author folder.

```markdown
---
layout: author
username: maktub82
displayname: Sergio Gallardo Sales
location: Madrid
url_full: https://twitter.com/maktub82
url: twitter.com/maktub82
bio: Delivery Manager en Plain Concepts
picture: assets/images/blog/authors/maktub82.jpeg
facebook: False
twitter: maktub82
feed: False
cover: False
robots: noindex
---
```

Then you have to modify the `_data/authors.yml` to add the author information.

```yml
maktub82:
  username: maktub82
  name: Sergio Gallardo Sales
  location: Madrid
  url_full: https://twitter.com/maktub82
  url: twitter.com/maktub82
  bio: Delivery Manager en Plain Concepts
  picture: assets/images/blog/maktub82.jpeg
  facebook: False
  twitter: maktub82
  feed: False
  cover: False
```

### Create tag
